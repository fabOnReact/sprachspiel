The old app is still available at https://sprachspiel.xyz

I have been working on a new version of this app which will be available as Web and Android Application.
The new application sourcecode is available at https://github.com/fabriziobertoglio1987/sprachspiel/tree/development

```
Ruby 2.3.3
Rails 5.1 

git clone git@github.com:fabriziobertoglio1987/sprachspiel.git
cd sprachspiel
git checkout development
rbenv local 2.3.3
bundle install
rails s
```
you find the app at `localhost:3000`
